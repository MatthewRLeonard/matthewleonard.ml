description: About me, Matthew Leonard, owner of this here website
title: About
---

I am Matthew Leonard, a Master of Data Science student at the University of Newcastle. I am especially enthusiastic about R and and RStudio. One night, late, deep in code, I thought to myself, "I love this stuff. This is all I wanna do." Hence the phrase/title, "Just Wanna [RStats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)".

I am always coding, always reading, always learning. I like wrangling, analysing and modelling data, but of late have taken a particular interest in visualising data / data graphics. For instance, the design of tables and graphs as well the development and layout of dashboards and web apps.

I made this website to:

* see if I could do it
* refresh my HTML/CSS/JS skills (it'd been a minute)
* have a site to house/link to my projects
* have a nice spot for my CV to live
* teach people some things I've learnt along the way
* re-teach a future me some things I once knew
* show people I can code
* show people I can data
* show people I can write

This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) with [Blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/), an edited [Clarity](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-clarity/) theme, and is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) via [GitHub](https://github.com/).

A future post will detail how it was all done, from go to whoa.
